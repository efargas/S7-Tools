## Recent Achievements

### Bottom Panel Redesign (Current Session)
**Problem Solved**: Bottom panel was using traditional TabControl which didn't match the VSCode-style design of activity bar and sidebar.

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Structural Changes**:
   - Replaced TabControl with ItemsControl + horizontal StackPanel
   - Added selection indicator (blue bottom border) matching activity bar style
   - Maintained 35px height consistency with other panels

2. **Behavioral Improvements**:
   - VSCode-like selection: clicking selected item toggles panel visibility
   - Smart expansion: clicking any item when collapsed expands panel
   - Proper state management with IsSelected property updates

3. **Visual Enhancements**:
   - Consistent color scheme: #007ACC (accent), #858585 (inactive), #FFFFFF (active/hover)
   - Hover effects with white text
   - Tooltips for better UX
   - Seamless integration with existing design

**Files Modified**:
- `MainWindow.axaml`: Complete bottom panel UI restructure
- `MainWindowViewModel.cs`: Enhanced selection logic and initialization

**Testing**: âœ… Build successful, application runs correctly with new behavior
