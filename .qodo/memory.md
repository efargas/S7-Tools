# S7-Tools Development Memory

## Project Overview
S7-Tools is an Avalonia-based desktop application with a VSCode-style interface for PLC (Siemens S7) operations. The application features a modern dark theme with activity bar, sidebar, main content area, bottom panel, and status bar.

## Architecture
- **Framework**: Avalonia UI (.NET 8)
- **Pattern**: MVVM with ReactiveUI
- **Structure**: Modular design with services, view models, and views
- **Styling**: VSCode-inspired dark theme with consistent color scheme

## Recent Implementations

### ✅ Bottom Panel Redesign (Completed)
**Date**: Current session
**Goal**: Transform bottom panel from traditional TabControl to activity bar-style horizontal layout

**Changes Made**:
1. **UI Structure**:
   - Replaced TabControl with ItemsControl using horizontal StackPanel
   - Added accent rectangle highlight (blue #007ACC bottom border) for selected items
   - Implemented proper selection indicators matching activity bar design

2. **Behavior Implementation**:
   - **Selection Logic**: Clicking selected item toggles panel visibility (expand/collapse)
   - **Navigation Logic**: Clicking non-selected item expands panel and selects tab
   - **State Management**: Proper IsSelected property updates across all tabs

3. **Visual Enhancements**:
   - **Text Colors**: Gray (#858585) for non-selected, white (#FFFFFF) for selected/hovered
   - **Hover Effects**: White text on hover using Button:pointerover TextBlock selector
   - **Tooltips**: Added tooltips showing tab headers on hover
   - **Consistent Styling**: Matches activity bar and sidebar visual design

4. **Files Modified**:
   - `src/S7Tools/Views/MainWindow.axaml`: Complete bottom panel UI redesign
   - `src/S7Tools/ViewModels/MainWindowViewModel.cs`: Updated selection logic and initialization

**Technical Details**:
- Used existing BooleanToColorConverter for selected/non-selected states
- Maintained VSCode-like behavior patterns
- Preserved existing command structure and data binding
- Added proper initialization for first tab selection

**Result**: Bottom panel now behaves identically to activity bar and sidebar with consistent visual styling and interaction patterns.

## Current State
- ✅ Activity Bar: Fully functional with proper selection and toggle behavior
- ✅ Sidebar: Working with content switching and visibility toggle
- ✅ Bottom Panel: Redesigned with activity bar-style behavior and styling
- ✅ Main Content Area: Displays content based on activity bar selection
- ✅ Status Bar: Basic implementation in place

## Next Implementation Goals
1. **Content Enhancement**: Improve content areas with more detailed views
2. **Log Viewer**: Implement proper log viewer functionality in bottom panel
3. **PLC Connection**: Enhance connections view with actual PLC communication
4. **Settings Panel**: Expand settings with theme, layout, and connection options
5. **Performance**: Optimize UI responsiveness and memory usage

## Technical Notes
- All UI components follow VSCode color scheme (#007ACC accent, #858585 inactive, #FFFFFF active)
- Consistent 35px height for headers and panels
- Proper MVVM separation maintained throughout
- ReactiveUI commands used for all user interactions
- Avalonia styling system leveraged for hover and selection states

## Development Environment
- IDE: VS Code with C# extensions
