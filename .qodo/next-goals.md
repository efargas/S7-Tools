- [ ] Connection defaults and timeouts
- [ ] Logging preferences (levels, retention)
- [ ] Language/localization settings
- [ ] Settings persistence to user profile

**Files to Modify**:

**Goal**: Proper file/project explorer functionality

**Tasks**:
- [ ] File system navigation
- [ ] Project file management
- [ ] Recent files/projects
- [ ] Bookmarks/favorites
- [ ] Context menus for file operations

### 5. Content Area Improvements ðŸŽ¯ MEDIUM PRIORITY

2. **Connections Management** - Core PLC functionality
3. **Settings Panel** - User customization and preferences

### Phase 3B: Content Enhancement (Following Sessions)
1. **Explorer Improvements** - Better file management
2. **Content Area** - Rich editing capabilities
3. **Data Visualization** - PLC data monitoring

### Phase 3C: Polish & Performance (Final Phase 3)
1. **Architecture Improvements** - Code quality and maintainability
2. **User Experience** - Polish and refinement
3. **Testing & Documentation** - Quality assurance

## Success Criteria

### Log Viewer Success
- [ ] Real-time log display with proper formatting
- [ ] Filtering and search functionality working
- [ ] Performance acceptable with large log volumes
- [ ] Integration with existing logging infrastructure

### Connections Success
- [ ] Can create, edit, and delete connection profiles
- [ ] Connection testing provides clear feedback
- [ ] Profiles persist between application sessions
- [ ] UI is intuitive and follows VSCode design patterns

### Settings Success
