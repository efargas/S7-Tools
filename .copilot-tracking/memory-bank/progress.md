- **Interface Segregation**: Focused interfaces for specific responsibilities

### PowerSupply Configuration Patterns Established

**Dynamic UI Pattern**:
```xml
<!-- Type-specific sections with conditional visibility -->
<Border IsVisible="{Binding IsModbusTcp}">
  <StackPanel><!-- ModbusTcp fields --></StackPanel>
</Border>
```

**Avalonia ComboBox Pattern**:
```csharp
// Index-based binding for Avalonia compatibility
public int PowerSupplyTypeIndex
{
    get => (int)PowerSupplyType;
    set => PowerSupplyType = (PowerSupplyType)value;
}
```

**Enum Synchronization Pattern**:
```csharp
// Enum values aligned with UI ComboBox items
ModbusTcp = 0,      // "Modbus TCP"
SerialRs232 = 1,    // "Serial RS232"
SerialRs485 = 2,    // "Serial RS485"
EthernetIp = 3      // "Ethernet IP"
```

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Technical Debt
- **ReactiveUI Constraints**: Must use individual property subscriptions (not large WhenAnyValue calls)
- **Thread Safety**: Critical to use IUIThreadService for all UI updates
- **Memory Management**: Circular buffer prevents memory leaks but requires size management

### Integration Points
- **Dialog Service Enhancement**: Could benefit from further unification
- **Configuration Persistence**: File-based storage could be enhanced with database option
- **Error Handling**: Could be more user-friendly in some edge cases

### Performance Considerations
- **Startup Time**: Could be optimized with lazy loading patterns
- **Large Datasets**: Profile loading could benefit from pagination
- **Memory Usage**: Generally efficient but could be profiled for optimization
