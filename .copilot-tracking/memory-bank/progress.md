```csharp
// Index-based binding for Avalonia compatibility
public int PowerSupplyTypeIndex
{
    get => (int)PowerSupplyType;
    set => PowerSupplyType = (PowerSupplyType)value;
}
```

**Enum Synchronization Pattern**:
```csharp
// Enum values aligned with UI ComboBox items
ModbusTcp = 0,      // "Modbus TCP"
SerialRs232 = 1,    // "Serial RS232"
SerialRs485 = 2,    // "Serial RS485"
EthernetIp = 3      // "Ethernet IP"
```
