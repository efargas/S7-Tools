# Product Context: S7Tools

**Last Updated**: Current Session  
**Context Type**: Product Vision and User Experience  

## Why This Project Exists

### **Problem Statement**

Industrial automation engineers working with **Siemens S7-1200 PLCs** face several critical challenges:

1. **Fragmented Tooling** - Existing tools are often proprietary, expensive, or lack modern UI/UX
2. **Limited Debugging Capabilities** - Poor logging and real-time monitoring options
3. **Inefficient Workflows** - Cumbersome interfaces that slow down development and troubleshooting
4. **Cross-Platform Limitations** - Most tools are Windows-only, limiting deployment flexibility
5. **Poor Integration** - Tools don't integrate well with modern development workflows

### **Market Gap**

The industrial automation software market lacks:
- **Modern, intuitive interfaces** comparable to contemporary development tools
- **Comprehensive logging systems** for real-time debugging and monitoring
- **Cross-platform solutions** that work on Windows, Linux, and macOS
- **Open, extensible architectures** that can be customized for specific needs

## Problems S7Tools Solves

### **Primary Problems**

#### 1. **Inefficient PLC Development Workflow**
- **Current State**: Engineers use multiple disconnected tools for PLC communication, monitoring, and debugging
- **S7Tools Solution**: Unified interface with integrated logging, monitoring, and communication tools
- **Impact**: Reduced context switching and improved productivity

#### 2. **Poor Real-Time Debugging Experience**
- **Current State**: Limited logging capabilities and poor visibility into PLC communication
- **S7Tools Solution**: Advanced logging system with real-time display, filtering, and export capabilities
- **Impact**: Faster problem identification and resolution

#### 3. **Outdated User Interfaces**
- **Current State**: Industrial software often has outdated, unintuitive interfaces
- **S7Tools Solution**: Modern VSCode-like interface with familiar navigation patterns
- **Impact**: Reduced learning curve and improved user satisfaction

#### 4. **Platform Lock-in**
- **Current State**: Most industrial tools are Windows-only
- **S7Tools Solution**: Cross-platform desktop application using Avalonia UI
- **Impact**: Deployment flexibility and broader accessibility

### **Secondary Problems**

#### 1. **Limited Extensibility**
- **Current State**: Proprietary tools with limited customization options
- **S7Tools Solution**: Service-oriented architecture with plugin potential
- **Impact**: Customizable workflows and future extensibility

#### 2. **Poor Integration with Modern Development Practices**
- **Current State**: Industrial tools don't integrate with modern CI/CD or version control
- **S7Tools Solution**: Modern .NET architecture compatible with contemporary development practices
- **Impact**: Better integration with existing development workflows

## How S7Tools Should Work

### **Core User Experience**

#### **Primary Workflow: PLC Monitoring and Debugging**

1. **Connection Setup**
   - User opens S7Tools and navigates to Connections view
   - Configures PLC connection parameters (IP, rack, slot, timeouts)
   - Tests connection and saves configuration for future use

2. **Real-Time Monitoring**
   - User selects tags or data blocks to monitor
   - Real-time data display with automatic refresh
   - Visual indicators for data changes and connection status

3. **Debugging and Logging**
   - All PLC communication automatically logged with timestamps
   - User can filter logs by level, time range, or search terms
   - Export capabilities for offline analysis and reporting

4. **Data Analysis**
   - Historical data visualization with charts and graphs
   - Export data in multiple formats (CSV, JSON, Excel)
   - Integration with external analysis tools

### **User Interface Design Philosophy**

#### **VSCode-Inspired Design**
- **Activity Bar** - Primary navigation with icons for major functions
- **Sidebar** - Context-sensitive content based on selected activity
- **Main Editor Area** - Primary workspace for data visualization and editing
- **Bottom Panel** - Logging, debugging, and status information
- **Status Bar** - Connection status, application state, and quick actions

#### **Design Principles**
1. **Familiarity** - Leverage patterns developers already know from VSCode
2. **Efficiency** - Minimize clicks and context switching
3. **Visibility** - Important information always visible or easily accessible
4. **Consistency** - Consistent behavior and visual design throughout
5. **Responsiveness** - Immediate feedback for all user actions

### **Key User Scenarios**

#### **Scenario 1: Daily PLC Monitoring**
- **User**: Maintenance engineer monitoring production line
- **Goal**: Quickly check PLC status and identify any issues
- **Experience**: Opens S7Tools, connects to PLC, views real-time dashboard with key metrics
- **Success**: Can identify and diagnose issues within minutes

#### **Scenario 2: Troubleshooting Communication Issues**
- **User**: Automation engineer debugging PLC communication problems
- **Goal**: Identify root cause of intermittent communication failures
- **Experience**: Uses advanced logging to capture detailed communication traces, filters by error level
- **Success**: Pinpoints exact cause of communication issues using log analysis

#### **Scenario 3: System Integration Testing**
- **User**: System integrator validating PLC integration
- **Goal**: Verify all data points are communicating correctly
- **Experience**: Sets up comprehensive monitoring of all tags, exports data for validation
- **Success**: Generates comprehensive test reports proving system functionality
