**Last Updated**: Current Session
**Context Type**: Product Vision and User Experience

## Why This Project Exists

### **Problem Statement**

Industrial automation engineers and security researchers working with **Siemens S7-1200 PLCs** face several critical challenges:

1. **Fragmented Tooling** - Existing tools are often proprietary, expensive, or lack modern UI/UX
2. **Limited Memory Analysis** - No unified tools for systematic PLC memory dumping and analysis
3. **Manual Bootloader Operations** - Complex manual processes for memory extraction via bootloader access
4. **Inefficient Workflows** - Cumbersome interfaces that slow down development and security research
5. **Cross-Platform Limitations** - Most tools are Windows-only, limiting deployment flexibility
6. **Poor Job Management** - No systematic approach to manage, schedule, and execute memory dump operations
7. **Resource Conflicts** - Manual coordination required when using shared hardware resources

### **Market Gap**

The industrial automation and PLC security research market lacks:
- **Modern, intuitive interfaces** comparable to contemporary development tools
- **Systematic memory analysis tools** for PLC firmware and bootloader research
- **Automated job management** for complex multi-step hardware operations
- **Resource coordination systems** for parallel hardware operations
- **Cross-platform solutions** that work on Windows, Linux, and macOS
- **Open, extensible architectures** that can be customized for specific research needs

## Problems S7Tools Solves

### **Primary Problems**

#### 1. **Complex PLC Memory Analysis Workflow**

- **S7Tools Solution**: Automated job management system with systematic memory dump operations
- **Impact**: Reduced manual effort and improved reliability for security research and firmware analysis

#### 2. **Lack of Systematic Job Management**
- **Current State**: Manual coordination of hardware resources and multi-step operations
- **S7Tools Solution**: Task Manager with job scheduling, queuing, and parallel execution capabilities
- **Impact**: Efficient resource utilization and systematic operation execution

#### 3. **Resource Coordination Complexity**
- **Current State**: Manual tracking of hardware resource usage (serial ports, power supplies, network ports)
- **S7Tools Solution**: Automated resource coordination with conflict detection and resolution
- **Impact**: Parallel operations when possible, intelligent queuing when resources conflict

#### 4. **Poor Real-Time Operation Monitoring**
- **Current State**: Limited visibility into long-running bootloader operations and memory dump progress
- **S7Tools Solution**: Advanced logging system with real-time progress tracking and detailed operation logs
- **Impact**: Better visibility and control over complex hardware operations

#### 5. **Outdated User Interfaces**
- **Current State**: Command-line tools and outdated interfaces for complex multi-step operations
- **S7Tools Solution**: Modern VSCode-like interface with task management and job configuration
- **Impact**: Reduced learning curve and improved user productivity

### **Secondary Problems**

#### 1. **Limited Automation for Complex Operations**
- **Current State**: Manual execution of multi-step bootloader operations
- **S7Tools Solution**: Job templates and automated execution sequences
- **Impact**: Consistent, repeatable operations with reduced human error

#### 2. **Poor Integration with Modern Development Practices**
- **Current State**: Industrial tools don't integrate with modern CI/CD or version control
- **S7Tools Solution**: Modern .NET architecture compatible with contemporary development practices
- **Impact**: Better integration with existing development workflows

#### 3. **Lack of Operation Standardization**
- **Current State**: Inconsistent approaches to PLC memory analysis across teams
- **S7Tools Solution**: Standardized job definitions, templates, and execution workflows
- **Impact**: Improved collaboration and knowledge sharing

## How S7Tools Should Work

### **Core User Experience**

#### **Primary Workflow: Automated PLC Memory Dumping**

1. **Job Configuration**
   - User navigates to Jobs activity in the sidebar
   - Creates new job with name, description, and configuration
   - Selects required profiles: Serial Port, Socat, Power Supply, Memory Region
   - Configures timing parameters: power on/off delays, operation timeouts
   - Sets output path and naming conventions

2. **Task Management**
   - User switches to Task Manager activity
   - Reviews job configuration in main content area
   - Initiates task execution with start button
   - Monitors real-time progress with detailed operation logs
   - Manages multiple concurrent tasks with resource coordination

3. **Automated Execution Sequence**
   - System configures serial port using stty and selected profile
   - Launches socat server with conflict detection
   - Establishes modbus connection to power supply
   - Executes power cycle sequence (OFF → delay → ON → boot delay)
   - Enters bootloader mode via power cycle (OFF → delay → ON)
   - Performs bootloader handshaking and version verification
   - Installs stager payload (with optional user confirmation)
   - Installs dumper payload and executes memory dump
   - Saves memory dump to configured output path

4. **Parallel Operations & Resource Management**
   - System automatically detects resource conflicts
   - Executes jobs in parallel when using different hardware resources
   - Queues conflicting jobs for sequential execution
   - Shares power supplies across different output channels when possible

### **User Interface Design Philosophy**

#### **VSCode-Inspired Design**
- **Activity Bar** - Primary navigation: Task Manager, Jobs, Settings, Logs
- **Sidebar** - Context-sensitive content with collapsible groups:
  - Task Manager: Created Jobs, Scheduled Tasks, Queued Tasks, Active Tasks, Finished Tasks
  - Jobs: All Jobs, Job Templates, Job Categories
  - Settings: Serial Profiles, Socat Profiles, Power Supply Profiles, Memory Region Profiles
- **Main Content Area** - Job configuration, task details, execution progress, and results
- **Bottom Panel** - Real-time logging, operation details, and system status
- **Status Bar** - Hardware connection status, active task count, and system health

#### **Design Principles**
1. **Familiarity** - Leverage patterns developers already know from VSCode
2. **Efficiency** - Minimize clicks and context switching
