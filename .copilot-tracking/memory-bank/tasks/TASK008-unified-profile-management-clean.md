# [TASK008] - Unified Profile Management Architecture Implementation

**Status:** In Progress
**Added:** 2025-10-14
**Updated:** 2025-10-14

## Original Request

Complete the implementation of unified profile management architecture across all three profile types (Serial, Socat, PowerSupply) in the S7Tools application. This task focuses on standardizing CRUD operations, implementing consistent validation patterns, and ensuring clean compilation with the new IProfileManager interface.

## Thought Process

The unified profile management system represents a major architectural improvement for the S7Tools application. The decision to implement a unified interface pattern emerged from the need to eliminate code duplication and ensure consistent behavior across all profile types.

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **IProfileManager Interface**: Created a 145-line unified contract that standardizes all CRUD operations
2. **StandardProfileManager Base Class**: Implemented a 600+ line base class providing complete functionality
3. **Interface Inheritance Pattern**: Maintained type-specific interfaces for dependency injection
4. **Method Standardization**: Unified method signatures across all operations

### Implementation Strategy

The implementation followed a systematic approach:

- **Phase 1**: Architecture design and core interface implementation
- **Phase 2**: Service implementation updates
- **Phase 3**: ViewModels integration and method migration
- **Phase 4**: Build verification and testing

This approach ensured minimal disruption to existing functionality while establishing a solid foundation for future enhancements.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Architecture (COMPLETE)

- ‚úÖ Design and implement IProfileManager interface
- ‚úÖ Create StandardProfileManager base class
- ‚úÖ Update all profile services to inherit from unified interface
- ‚úÖ Verify compilation and basic functionality

### Phase 2: ViewModels Integration (COMPLETE)

- ‚úÖ Update all ViewModels to use unified interface methods
- ‚úÖ Replace legacy method calls with standardized equivalents
- ‚úÖ Update Program.cs diagnostic calls
- ‚úÖ Fix ProfileEditDialogService integration

### Phase 3: Dependency Injection Optimization (IN PROGRESS)

- üîÑ Update ServiceCollectionExtensions to leverage IProfileManager pattern
- üîÑ Optimize service lifetime management and interface resolution
- üîÑ Verify proper DI container configuration

### Phase 4: Template Method Integration (PENDING)

- ‚è≥ Verify ProfileManagementViewModelBase compatibility
- ‚è≥ Ensure template method pattern works with unified interface
- ‚è≥ Test base class functionality with new methods

### Phase 5: Comprehensive Testing (PENDING)

- ‚è≥ Functionality testing across all profile operations
- ‚è≥ Create, Edit, Delete, Duplicate operation validation
- ‚è≥ Import/Export functionality verification
- ‚è≥ Performance and reliability testing

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** In Progress - 80% Complete
