# [TASK012] - Socat Process Investigation

**Status:** Completed
**Added:** 2025-10-15
**Updated:** 2025-10-15

## Original Request
Debug socat process startup issues preventing execution - "button remains disabled" and "no process is started after hitting start". User reported critical UI functionality failure requiring comprehensive debugging to identify race conditions and deadlock issues.

## Thought Process
The Socat service was experiencing critical startup failures preventing TCP-to-serial bridging functionality. User reported that socat processes were not starting and UI buttons remained disabled after attempting to start processes.

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: The investigation revealed a severe semaphore deadlock in `SocatService.StartSocatWithProfileAsync()` where `IsPortInUseAsync()` was called while the same semaphore was already held, causing indefinite hangs.

The resolution required implementing the **Internal Method Pattern** - creating semaphore-safe internal methods that can be called from within locked contexts without attempting to acquire the same semaphore again.

**Key Architecture Lesson**: Always audit call chains within semaphore-locked sections to prevent nested semaphore acquisition deadlocks.

## Implementation Plan

- [x] Review SocatService.StartSocatAsync() implementation - **CRITICAL DEADLOCK DISCOVERED**
- [x] Add comprehensive debug logging with emoji markers for async flow tracking
- [x] Timeline analysis revealed 5+ second execution gaps indicating semaphore deadlock
- [x] Identify nested semaphore call: `IsPortInUseAsync()` within `StartSocatWithProfileAsync()`
- [x] Implement Internal Method Pattern: `IsPortInUseInternalAsync()` for semaphore-safe operations
- [x] Verify proper semaphore release in finally blocks
- [x] User verification: "working ok" - functionality fully restored

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100%

## Progress Log

### 2025-10-15

- **ðŸŽ‰ CRITICAL BREAKTHROUGH**: Discovered and resolved semaphore deadlock in `SocatService.StartSocatWithProfileAsync()`
- **Root Cause**: `IsPortInUseAsync()` called while same semaphore already held, causing indefinite hang
- **Solution**: Created `IsPortInUseInternalAsync()` method for internal use without semaphore acquisition
- **Timeline Analysis**: Debug logs revealed exact 5+ second execution gaps indicating deadlock location
- **User Verification**: âœ… "working ok" - socat processes now start successfully
- **Architecture Impact**: Established Internal Method Pattern for all future semaphore-safe operations
- **Documentation**: Added critical deadlock detection patterns to memory bank instructions
