# [TASK011] - Dialog UI Improvements

**Status:** Pending
**Added:** 2025-10-15
**Updated:** 2025-10-15

## Original Request
Enhance profile edit dialogs with visual polish and UX improvements: Add borders, [X] close button in title bar, make draggable by title bar, make resizable.

## Thought Process
The current profile edit dialogs are functional but lack visual polish and standard window behaviors that users expect from desktop applications. The dialogs currently appear as basic modal windows without the typical window chrome features.

Key improvements needed:
1. **Visual Enhancement**: Add proper borders and styling to make dialogs look more professional
2. **Close Button**: Add standard [X] button in title bar for intuitive closing
3. **Draggable Behavior**: Enable dragging by title bar for better UX
4. **Resizable Capability**: Allow users to resize dialogs for better content visibility

This is a polish task that improves user experience without affecting core functionality.

## Implementation Plan
- [ ] Add border styling to ProfileEditDialog.axaml
- [ ] Implement title bar with close button
- [ ] Enable drag behavior on title bar area
- [ ] Make dialog window resizable
- [ ] Test across all three profile types (Serial, Socat, PowerSupply)
- [ ] Ensure consistent styling with application theme
