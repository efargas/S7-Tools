# [TASK017] - Task Manager and Jobs Implementation

**Status:** In Progress (Reopened with UI refactor + new profile work)
**Added:** 2025-01-17
**Updated:** 2025-10-17
**Priority:** High
**Complexity:** High

## Summary

Implement the core S7Tools functionality: Task Manager and Jobs system for automated S7-1200 PLC memory dumping operations. This includes VSCode-style activity bar navigation, job creation/management, task scheduling, and parallel execution with resource coordination.

## New Requirements (2025-10-17)

Based on the latest UI review (see screenshots), we are reopening this task with additional scope:

- Refactor the new views highlighted in red to improve layout and readability.
- Add the memory-dump profiler as MemoryRegionProfile in the unified profile system.
- Convert the Job Creator into a wizard-style flow:
  - Each step selects one profile type (Serial, Socat, Power Supply, Memory Dump) via a ComboBox.
  - Display the full details of the selected profile directly below the selection (read-only panel), so users can verify configuration without leaving the step.
  - Provide Back/Next/Finish navigation with validation gating.

Assumptions:
- The "memory-dump profiler" refers to the existing MemoryRegionProfile concept; we will use the name MemoryRegionProfile (not introduce a new type).
- The wizard will be presented in the main content area (Job Creator view), not in a dialog, following our ReactiveUI and MVVM patterns.

## Context & Motivation

S7Tools needs its primary functionality: orchestrating automated memory dumps of S7-1200 PLCs with compatible bootloader versions. The system must:

1. **Manage Jobs** - Create, modify, save, delete, and template-based job configurations
2. **Schedule Tasks** - Queue, schedule, and execute tasks with resource coordination
3. **Coordinate Resources** - Handle parallel execution when resources don't conflict
4. **Integrate Bootloader Logic** - Use existing S7 bootloader integration for memory operations

## Architecture Overview

### Activity Bar Structure
