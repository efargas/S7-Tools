## Recent Activity Summary

**Latest Critical Achievement (2025-10-15):**

ðŸŽ‰ **TASK012: Socat Process Investigation COMPLETE** - User confirmed "working ok"

**Critical Issue Resolved**:
- **Problem**: Socat processes failing to start, UI buttons remaining disabled
- **Root Cause**: Severe semaphore deadlock in `SocatService.StartSocatWithProfileAsync()`
- **Deadlock Pattern**: `IsPortInUseAsync()` called while same semaphore already held
- **Solution**: Implemented Internal Method Pattern with `IsPortInUseInternalAsync()`
- **Debug Infrastructure**: Comprehensive emoji-marked logging for async flow tracking
- **User Verification**: âœ… "working ok" - socat functionality fully restored

**Technical Excellence Demonstrated**:
- Critical deadlock detection through timeline analysis (5+ second execution gaps)
- Internal Method Pattern for semaphore-safe operations within locked contexts
- Comprehensive async operation flow tracking with emoji-marked debug logs
- Proper exception handling with guaranteed semaphore release in finally blocks
- User acceptance testing with confirmed functionality restoration

**Previous Achievement (2025-10-15):**

âœ… **PowerSupply ModbusTcp Configuration Complete** - User confirmed "working ok now"
- Dynamic configuration fields with type-based visibility
- ModbusTcp settings: Host/IP, Port, Device ID, On/Off Coil, Address Base
- Avalonia ComboBox compatibility fixes (SelectedIndex approach)
- Enum synchronization between domain model and UI
- All compilation and XAML loading errors resolved

**Next Development Priorities**:

1. **Dialog UI Improvements** (TASK011) - Visual enhancements for edit dialogs
2. **PLC Communication Module** - Begin Siemens S7-1200 protocol implementation
3. **Advanced Configuration Management** - Enhanced profile management features
4. **Performance Optimization** - Profile application for large datasets
