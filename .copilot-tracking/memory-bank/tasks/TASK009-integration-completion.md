# [TASK009] - Dependency Injection and Template Method Integration

**Status:** Pending
**Added:** 2025-10-14
**Updated:** 2025-10-14

## Original Request

Complete the remaining integration tasks for the unified profile management system. This includes optimizing dependency injection patterns to fully leverage the IProfileManager interface and verifying that the ProfileManagementViewModelBase template method pattern works correctly with the new unified interface.

## Thought Process

With the core unified profile management architecture now complete and ViewModels successfully migrated, the remaining work focuses on two critical integration areas:

1. **Dependency Injection Optimization**: The current service registration can be enhanced to better utilize the unified IProfileManager interface pattern
2. **Template Method Pattern Verification**: Ensure that ProfileManagementViewModelBase works seamlessly with the new interface

These tasks represent the final steps needed to complete the unified profile management system integration.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Dependency Injection Updates (2-3 hours)

- Update ServiceCollectionExtensions to leverage IProfileManager pattern more effectively
- Optimize service lifetime management and interface resolution
- Verify proper DI container configuration
- Test service resolution for all profile types

### Phase 2: ProfileManagementViewModelBase Integration (2-3 hours)

- Verify ProfileManagementViewModelBase compatibility with unified interface
- Ensure template method pattern works with new standardized methods
- Test base class functionality with all profile types
- Update any incompatible patterns or method calls

### Phase 3: Comprehensive Testing (3-4 hours)

- Functionality testing across all profile operations
- Create, Edit, Delete, Duplicate operation validation
- Import/Export functionality verification
- Performance and reliability testing
- User acceptance testing

### Phase 4: Documentation and Cleanup (1-2 hours)

- Update memory bank documentation with final patterns
- Document best practices for future development
- Clean up any temporary code or comments
- Finalize TASK008 status and create completion summary

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Not Started - Ready to Begin
