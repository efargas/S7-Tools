# [TASK012] - Socat Process Investigation

**Status:** Pending
**Added:** 2025-10-15
**Updated:** 2025-10-15

## Original Request
Debug socat process startup issues preventing execution. Follow investigation checklist: Check SocatService implementation, verify process configuration, validate serial device access, test socat installation, review profile configuration, enable verbose logging.

## Thought Process
The Socat service is currently experiencing startup failures that prevent TCP-to-serial bridging functionality from working. This is a critical issue affecting the core functionality of the application for users who need to bridge TCP connections to serial devices.

The investigation needs to be systematic to identify whether the issue is:
1. **Code-level**: SocatService implementation problems
2. **Configuration-level**: Invalid process parameters or profile settings
3. **System-level**: Missing socat installation or permissions
4. **Device-level**: Serial device access or availability issues

Given that the Serial Ports configuration works separately (per architecture decision), the focus should be on the socat process execution itself and the TCP bridging functionality.

## Implementation Plan
- [ ] Review SocatService.StartSocatAsync() implementation
- [ ] Verify process configuration and argument construction
- [ ] Test socat installation and version compatibility
- [ ] Validate serial device access permissions
- [ ] Enable verbose logging for process debugging
- [ ] Test with minimal socat command line manually
- [ ] Fix identified issues and verify functionality
