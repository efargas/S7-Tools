## Next Steps for Implementation

### Phase 3: Bootloader Integration Enhancement (CURRENT)
**Objective**: Enhance existing bootloader service with new progress tracking capabilities

**Current Bootloader Service Analysis**:
- ‚úÖ Complete dump operation sequence already implemented
- ‚úÖ Progress reporting interface (IProgress<(string stage, double percent)>) established
- üîÑ **Need Enhancement**: Integration with TaskExecution progress tracking
- üîÑ **Need Enhancement**: Better error recovery and retry mechanisms
- üîÑ **Need Enhancement**: Detailed operation logging and diagnostics

**Specific Tasks for Phase 3**:
1. **Enhanced Progress Reporting**: Integrate TaskExecution progress updates with bootloader operations
2. **Error Recovery**: Add retry mechanisms and error recovery patterns for bootloader failures
3. **Operation Logging**: Detailed logging of each step in the 10-step memory dump sequence
4. **Resource Integration**: Ensure proper resource coordination during bootloader operations

### Phase 4: UI Implementation (NEXT)
**Objective**: Create comprehensive UI for job management and task monitoring

**Key Components**:
1. **Activity Bar Enhancement**: Add Task Manager and Jobs activities to existing VSCode-style bar
2. **TaskManagerViewModel**: Real-time task monitoring with state-based collections
3. **JobsManagementViewModel**: Job CRUD operations with template management
4. **Job Configuration Dialogs**: Profile selection, memory region config, validation
5. **Progress Monitoring Views**: Real-time task progress with detailed status updates

### Architecture Foundation Ready

**Existing Foundation**:
- ‚úÖ Unified profile management architecture with StandardProfileManager pattern
- ‚úÖ Clean architecture with proper layer separation and dependency injection
- ‚úÖ Custom exception handling throughout all layers
- ‚úÖ Reactive MVVM patterns with ReactiveUI established
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive logging infrastructure for operation monitoring

**Integration Points Identified**:
- ‚úÖ Existing bootloader components in S7Tools.Core ready for enhancement
- ‚úÖ Profile management system ready for job configuration integration
- ‚úÖ Activity bar infrastructure ready for new activities
- ‚úÖ Logging infrastructure ready for detailed operation monitoring

## Implementation Guidelines for Continuing Session

### Recommended Next: Phase 3 - Bootloader Integration Enhancement

1. **Analyze Existing Bootloader Service**: Review current IBootloaderService implementation
2. **Enhance Progress Reporting**: Integrate with TaskExecution progress model
3. **Add Error Recovery**: Implement retry mechanisms and failure recovery patterns
4. **Improve Logging**: Add detailed operation logging for diagnostics

### Success Criteria for Phase 3
- [ ] Enhanced progress reporting integrated with TaskExecution
- [ ] Error recovery mechanisms implemented for bootloader operations
- [ ] Comprehensive logging of all bootloader operation steps
- [ ] Resource coordination during bootloader execution
- [ ] Clean build with enhanced bootloader service

### Critical Design Decisions for Phase 3
1. **Progress Integration**: How to map bootloader progress to TaskExecution updates
2. **Error Recovery**: What failures should trigger automatic retry vs. manual intervention
3. **Logging Detail**: Balance between diagnostic detail and log volume
4. **Resource Management**: Ensuring proper resource locks during long-running operations

## Blockers and Dependencies

**None** - All Phase 1 and 2 prerequisites completed successfully

## Context for Future Sessions

Phase 1 and 2 of TASK017 have been successfully completed with excellent technical quality. The system now has:

- Complete job management infrastructure with template support
- Advanced task scheduling with parallel execution capabilities
- Comprehensive resource coordination preventing conflicts
- Rich domain models with proper validation and business logic
- Seamless integration with existing S7Tools architecture

The next session should continue with Phase 3 bootloader integration enhancement, followed by UI implementation in Phase 4. The foundation is solid and ready for the remaining phases of implementation.

The focus continues on core business functionality delivery, with the task manager and jobs system representing the primary value-delivering features for S7Tools users.
3. **Exception Constructor Design** - Provided multiple constructors for different use cases
