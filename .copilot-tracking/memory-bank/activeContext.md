## Current Work Focus

### **Primary Focus: TASK007 - UI & Logging System Fixes**

**Objective**: Fix critical logging system issues and improve UI controls  
**Status**: Phase 1 Complete, Phase 2 In Progress  
**Priority**: Critical  

**Current Activities**:
1. ‚úÖ **Logging System Fix** - Fixed DataStore logger provider registration in Program.cs

### **Secondary Focus: Project Status Consolidation**

**Objective**: Resolve discrepancies between tracking files and actual implementation  
**Status**: Identified Issues  
**Priority**: High  

**Key Issues Identified**:
- Multiple conflicting tracking systems (`.copilot-tracking`, `.qodo`, `.github`)
- Outdated status information claiming incomplete features that are actually implemented
- Tracking files showing "Phase 1 needs compilation fixes" when application appears functional
- Misaligned implementation claims about LogViewer status

## Next Steps

### **Immediate Actions (Current Session)**

1. **‚úÖ Complete Memory Bank Core Files**
   - ‚úÖ projectbrief.md
   - ‚úÖ productContext.md  
   - ‚úÖ systemPatterns.md
   - ‚úÖ techContext.md
   - üîÑ activeContext.md (this file)
   - üìã progress.md
   - üìã tasks/ folder structure

2. **üìã Establish Task Management System**
   - Create tasks/_index.md with current project tasks
   - Create individual task files for active work items
   - Establish task tracking workflow

3. **üìã Create Instructions File**
   - Document project-specific patterns and preferences
   - Capture development workflow insights
   - Establish coding standards and practices

### **Short-Term Actions (Next Sessions)**

1. **Status Consolidation**
   - Review and update all tracking files for accuracy
   - Archive outdated or duplicate documentation
   - Establish single source of truth for project status

2. **Testing Framework Implementation**
   - Set up xUnit testing projects
   - Create test structure mirroring source projects
   - Implement initial unit tests for core services

3. **PLC Communication Development**
   - Research S7-1200 communication protocols
   - Design PLC service interfaces
   - Implement basic connection and data exchange

### **Medium-Term Goals (Future Sessions)**

1. **Configuration Management**
   - Implement strongly-typed configuration system
   - Add user preferences and settings persistence
   - Create configuration UI in Settings view

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Profile application performance
   - Optimize memory usage and UI responsiveness
   - Implement performance monitoring

3. **Documentation Enhancement**
   - Create user documentation and help system
   - Document API and integration patterns
   - Establish deployment and installation guides

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### **Memory Bank Structure Decision**

**Decision**: Implement full Memory Bank system as specified in instructions  
**Rationale**: Project has extensive documentation but lacks structured Memory Bank for session continuity  
**Impact**: Will enable consistent work across sessions with complete context preservation  

### **Status Tracking Consolidation**

**Decision**: Consolidate multiple tracking systems into Memory Bank structure  
**Rationale**: Current multiple tracking systems create confusion and conflicting information  
**Approach**: 
- Preserve valuable information from existing tracking
- Archive outdated or duplicate files
- Establish Memory Bank as single source of truth

### **Task Management Approach**

**Decision**: Implement structured task management with individual task files  
**Rationale**: Current project has complex status that needs detailed tracking  
**Structure**:
- tasks/_index.md for overview and status summary
- Individual TASKID-taskname.md files for detailed tracking
- Progress logging with subtask management

### **Testing Strategy Decision**

**Decision**: Implement comprehensive testing framework with xUnit  
**Rationale**: Current project has no formal testing, which is needed for reliability  
**Approach**:
- Mirror source structure in test projects
- Focus on service layer and business logic testing
- Use Moq for mocking dependencies

## Current Blockers and Challenges

### **Documentation Inconsistency**

**Issue**: Multiple tracking systems with conflicting status information  
**Impact**: Difficult to determine actual project status and next priorities  
**Resolution**: Memory Bank establishment will provide single source of truth  

### **Missing Test Framework**

**Issue**: No formal testing framework implemented  
**Impact**: Difficult to ensure code quality and prevent regressions  
**Resolution**: Planned for immediate implementation after Memory Bank completion  

### **PLC Communication Gap**

**Issue**: Core PLC communication functionality not yet implemented  
**Impact**: Application cannot fulfill primary purpose of PLC data management  
**Resolution**: Planned as next major development focus  

## Context for Next Session

### **Memory Bank Status**
- **Core Files**: 80% complete (5 of 7 core files created)
- **Task System**: Not yet established
- **Instructions**: Not yet created

### **Immediate Priorities**
1. Complete remaining Memory Bank files (progress.md, tasks system)
2. Create instructions.md with project-specific patterns
3. Establish task tracking for current and future work

### **Key Information for Continuation**
- Project is more advanced than tracking files indicate
- Focus should be on PLC communication and testing framework
- Memory Bank will provide foundation for consistent development
- Existing documentation in `.copilot-tracking/` contains valuable historical context

### **Success Criteria for Memory Bank Completion**
- All 7 core Memory Bank files created and populated
- Task management system established with current project status
- Instructions file created with project-specific patterns
- Clear roadmap established for future development priorities
