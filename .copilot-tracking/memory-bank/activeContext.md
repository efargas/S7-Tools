- **Tests**: ‚úÖ 178 tests passing (100% success rate)
- **Architecture**: ‚úÖ Clean Architecture principles maintained
- **Performance**: ‚úÖ Application running smoothly with all features functional

### Memory Bank Intelligence Captured
- **Semaphore Deadlock Prevention**: Internal Method Pattern documented
- **ReactiveUI Best Practices**: Individual property subscriptions established
- **Profile Management Architecture**: Unified template method pattern working
- **Cross-Platform UI Patterns**: Avalonia-specific binding approaches documented

### Recent Technical Patterns Established

**External Code Review Response Protocol**:
```markdown
1. Systematic Validation - Verify each finding against actual codebase
2. Priority Classification - Critical bugs vs quality improvements
3. Risk Assessment - Impact analysis for each proposed change
4. Strategic Implementation - Safe fixes immediately, defer risky changes
5. Task Creation - Document deferred improvements with detailed plans
```

**Semaphore-Safe Operation Pattern**:
```csharp
// Public API (thread-safe with semaphore)
public async Task<bool> PublicMethodAsync()
{
    await _semaphore.WaitAsync();
    try { return PublicMethodInternal(); }
    finally { _semaphore.Release(); }
}

// Internal method (assumes semaphore already held)
private bool PublicMethodInternal()
{
    // Safe to call from within semaphore-locked context
}
```

## Next Session Priorities - Phase 3: UI & Performance Optimizations

### Recommended Start: Task 3.1 - Compiled Bindings Audit

**Objective**: Audit and fix compiled bindings (x:DataType) across all views for optimal performance

**Implementation Approach**:
1. **Audit Phase**: Search for all .axaml files and identify missing x:DataType attributes
2. **Prioritization**: Focus on frequently-used views and complex data bindings first
3. **Implementation**: Add x:DataType attributes to UserControls and DataTemplates
4. **Verification**: Ensure bindings compile without errors and maintain functionality

**Files to Review**:
- `src/S7Tools/Views/*.axaml` - Main views
- `src/S7Tools/Views/**/*.axaml` - Nested views and user controls
- Focus on views with complex bindings and collections

**Expected Benefits**:
- Improved binding performance (compile-time vs runtime resolution)
- Better IntelliSense support in XAML editor
- Early detection of binding errors at compile time
- Reduced memory allocations from reflection

### Alternative: Task 3.2 - Design-Time ViewModels

**Objective**: Improve design-time ViewModels with mock services and sample data

**Benefits**:
- Better XAML designer experience
- Easier UI development and iteration
- Visual verification of layouts without running the app

### Phase 4 Options (Lower Priority)

**Task 4.1**: Enable TreatWarningsAsErrors (requires resolving all current warnings)
**Task 4.2**: Clean up backup files from source control

## Context for Next Agent
