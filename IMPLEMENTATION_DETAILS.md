**Last Updated**: 2025-10-13

## Feature: Siemens S7 Bootloader Integration

**Status**: Phase 1 Complete

### Implemented Functionality:
- **Core Models:** `Job`, `JobProfileSet`, and related models for managing bootloader tasks have been created in the `S7Tools.Core` project.
- **Core Services:**
    - `IJobScheduler` / `JobScheduler`: Manages the lifecycle of background jobs.
    - `IResourceCoordinator` / `ResourceCoordinator`: Prevents conflicts by managing access to shared resources.
    - `IBootloaderService` / `BootloaderService`: Orchestrates the bootloader process.
- **Adapter Pattern:** A suite of adapter classes (`PlcClientAdapter`, `SocatAdapter`, `PowerSupplyAdapter`, etc.) has been introduced to decouple the core services from external libraries and legacy dependencies. This promotes a cleaner architecture and allows for easier testing and maintenance.
- **Reference Stubs:** Stub implementations for external dependencies (`PowerControllerAdapter`, `PayloadManager`, `PlcProtocol`) have been created in the `S7Tools.Services.ReferenceStubs` namespace to allow for development and testing without requiring the actual hardware or external libraries.
- **Dependency Injection:** All new services, adapters, and view models have been registered in `ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs`.
- **UI:**
    - A new `TaskManagerView` and `TaskManagerViewModel` have been created to provide a user interface for creating and monitoring jobs.
    - The Task Manager is now accessible from the main navigation activity bar.
- **Unit Tests:** Unit tests for the `ResourceCoordinator` and `JobScheduler` services have been added to ensure their reliability.
- **Simulated PLC Communication:** Implemented simulated versions of `DumpMemoryAsync` and `InstallStagerAsync` in `PlcClientAdapter`. These methods now use `ILogger` to output their intended actions, simulate delays, and report progress, allowing for development and testing without physical PLC hardware.
- **Robust `SiemensS7Bootloader` Simulation:** Replaced the basic `PlcClient` stub with a more detailed `SimulatedPlcClient`. This new implementation provides a more realistic simulation of the `SiemensS7Bootloader`'s behavior, including logging, delays, and simulated data for all methods of the `IPlcClient` interface.
- **Bug Fixes & Refactoring:**
    - **DI Container:** Fixed a critical runtime error by correctly registering the `PowerControllerAdapter` in the dependency injection container.
    - **Namespaces:** Corrected namespace declarations across multiple new files in the `Adapters`, `ReferenceStubs`, and `Tasking` directories to align with the project's structure and resolve build errors.
    - **Test Stability:** Resolved a race condition in the `SchedulerTests` and a Moq verification issue to ensure all tests pass reliably.
    - **Code Cleanup:** Removed the unused `BooleanToVisibilityConverter` and updated its usages in the XAML files.
